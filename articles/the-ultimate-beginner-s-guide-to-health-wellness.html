            <div class="content">
                <p>Want to be healthier but don’t know where to start? No worries! Health & wellness isn’t about going on crazy diets or hitting the gym every day. It’s about small, sustainable changes that make a huge difference over time. Let’s break it down into simple steps that anyone can follow!</p>
                
                <h2>Step 1: Move More, Sit Less</h2>
                <p>Exercise isn’t just for bodybuilders or fitness influencers. Your body is designed to move! Sitting all day can mess up your posture, slow down your metabolism, and make you feel sluggish.</p>
                <p>Even if you can’t hit the gym, small changes help: Take the stairs, walk during calls, or just stretch every hour. It’s not about perfection—it’s about movement!</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Eat Like You Actually Care About Your Body</h2>
                <p>You don’t need to live off salads, but what you eat affects how you feel. Try to eat more real food—fruits, veggies, whole grains, and proteins. Processed junk food? Less is better.</p>
                <p>Not sure where to start? Just follow the 80/20 rule: Eat healthy 80% of the time, and enjoy your treats 20% of the time. Balance is key!</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Sleep Is the Ultimate Superpower</h2>
                <p>If you’re running on 4 hours of sleep, no amount of coffee will fix it. Sleep is when your body repairs itself, boosts immunity, and keeps your brain sharp.</p>
                <p>Try to get at least 7-9 hours of quality sleep. A good night’s sleep will do more for your health than any magic supplement ever will!</p>

                <h2>Step 4: Hydration is More Important Than You Think</h2>
                <p>Your body is 60% water. So if you’re dehydrated, you’re gonna feel tired, get headaches, and even mess up your digestion.</p>
                <p>Aim for 8-10 glasses of water daily. If you keep forgetting, get a water bottle and set reminders. Your body will thank you.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Mental Health Matters Just as Much as Physical Health</h2>
                <p>Taking care of your mind is just as important as taking care of your body. Stress, anxiety, and burnout can mess with your overall well-being.</p>
                <p>Practice self-care: Meditate, journal, talk to someone you trust, or just take breaks. Prioritizing your mental health is not selfish—it’s necessary.</p>

                <h2>Step 6: Health Is About Consistency, Not Perfection</h2>
                <p>Forget quick fixes. Health is a long-term game. You don’t need to be perfect—just consistent.</p>
                <p>Missed a workout? Had a cheat meal? No problem. Just get back on track and keep moving forward. Small steps every day lead to big results over time.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Being healthy isn’t about extreme diets or intense workouts—it’s about small, smart choices every day. Start where you are, do what you can, and enjoy the process.</p>
                <p>Remember: A healthier life isn’t about doing everything perfectly. It’s about doing the best you can with what you have. You got this!</p>
